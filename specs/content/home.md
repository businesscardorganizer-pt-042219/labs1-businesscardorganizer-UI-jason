# Home Page Content Sections

## Hero section

Should be all some prospects need to make the decision to sign up - direct, to the point, benefit-driven. Full window-sized banner.

- Headline
- Supporting copy - one or both of
    - Subheading
    - Brief copy
- Button with CTA label
- Brief privacy/disclaimer/supporting copy

## Navigation

Sticky once reaches top of window on scroll. On every page. Will be structured differently on mobile.

- Home
- About
- Features
- Contact
- Sign up button
- Login button

## Prospect Roadmap

This section is to give the prospect more at-a-glace material to understand the big picture

- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Key point 3

## Brand Narrative and/or Demo

A problem/solution-oriented journey through the product, its reasons for existing, and maybe a small tour of features (esp. if video is possible)

- Video _(if possible)_
- Text-based story _(if no video)_

## Testimonials

Make this a carousel with rotating media cards

## Key features and benefits

Dive more deeply into user benefits and the features that enable them - someone who gets to this point of the page is definitely interested but probably not sold yet.

Could be 2, 3, or more as needed.

- Key benefit #1
- Key benefit #2
- Key benefit #3

## Frequently Asked Questions

Make this an accordion with answer visibility toggled on clicking the question

## Final Call to Action

This should be on every page except contact and any legal info pages

Structure similar to hero section, though not necessarily full window-sized.

## Footer

Links and copyright/legal info. On every page.
